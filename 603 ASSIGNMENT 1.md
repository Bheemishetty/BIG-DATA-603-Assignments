    ï»¿1. Big Data with examples and types

Big Data is a collection of large or complex data that deals with non-traditional data yet grows exponentially with time. Big data is so massive that it cannot be managed by regular or traditional data storage software[1].

Example for Big Data :

One of the finest examples of Big data is Amazon web services. Aws platform provides big data services to many tech companies, The company has collected reams of information about the customer's purchases[2].

Google, Facebook, and Microsoft are also providing big data platforms.

Types of Big Data [3] :

1. Structured Data :

Structured data is organized data that stores data in a particular format or easily retrievable format such as Databases, spreadsheets, data sets, etc.

2. Un Structured Data :

Un Structured data is raw data which is in a non-organized data format that has different kinds of data such as in image/video format, integer, string data, etc. It is very complex to retrieve the data.

3. Semi-structured Data :

Semi-Structured data has some organizational structure but is complex to analyze it. It can be cleaned and could be imported into a relational database similar to structured data.

    2. 6 'V's of Big Data

The 6 V's of Big data are[4]:

1. Volume :

Big data is itself a large collection of data. Determining the value of the data size plays a crucial role. If the volume of the data is very large then it is considered Big Data. It depends on the volume of the data whether it is considered big data or not.

2. Velocity:

The velocity of the Big data refers to the high speed of retrieving and accumulation of the data. In big data, there is a flow of massive data continuously and the velocity determines the potential of the big data that how fast the data is generated ad processed to meet the demands.

3. Variety:

The variety refers to all types of data that are structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data and it also refers to heterogeneous data. Variety is basically the arrival of data from new sources that are both inside and outside of the enterprise.

4. Veracity:

Veracity refers to the inconsistencies and uncertainty in data. That is, readily available data can occasionally become disorganized, and quality and accuracy are challenging to manage.

Because there are so many different data dimensions arising from several dissimilar data types and sources, big data is also unpredictable.

5. Value :

Value in big data refers to the value you may derive from different types of data and how big data improves upon the outcomes of previously recorded data.

6. Variability :

Variability refers to how fast and to what extent your data is changing in the data storage.

    3. Phases of Big Data Analysis 

There are four essential phases in Big data Analysis[5] :

1. Data collection

In this initial phase, the data is collected from various sources from Databases, IOT sensors, Media platforms, and many other sources. This data can be structured or unstructured in format. Raw or Unstructured data that are too diverse or complex can be assigned in metadata and stored in the data lake.

2. Data Processing

In this phase of data analysis, the collected data is cleaned, transformed, and prepared for analysis. Techniques like Normalization, data filtration, and data integration are used in this data processing.

There are two types of processing, one is batch processing which is used for large blocks of data over a time period and the other is stream processing which is used to process small batches of data at once.

3. Data Cleaning

To increase data quality and produce more robust results, all data, regardless of size, must be scrubbed. Duplicate or unnecessary data must be removed or accounted for, and all data must be structured correctly. Dirty data can conceal and deceive, leading to inaccurate insights.

4. Data Analysing :

The analysis phase starts after the data has been prepared. Here, several methods are applied to the data in order to draw conclusions and information. Techniques like data mining, machine learning, statistical analysis, and visualization might be used in this.

    4. Challenges in Big Data analysis

The challenges of Big data analysis are [6] :

1. Storage

The main problem with the huge amounts of information generated every day is storage, especially when the data is in various formats. Traditional databases are unable to store unstructured data.

2. Processing

The act of reading, converting, extracting, and structuring meaningful information from raw data is referred to as processing big data. Information input and output in unified formats continue to be challenging.

3. Security

Organizations are very concerned about security. Information that isn't encrypted is vulnerable to theft or damage from hackers. Data security experts must therefore strike a compromise between maintaining stringent security protocols and granting users access to data.

4. Scaling Big Data Systems

Effective scaling techniques include read-only and write-active database separation, memory caching, transferring to the cloud, and database sharding. While each of those strategies is excellent on its own, combining them will take you further.
